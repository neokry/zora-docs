title: Bridging on Nouns Builder
---

##### What is bridging?
A blockchain bridge is a tool that connects two separate blockchain networks to enable assets to be transferred between them. This includes bridges that connect Ethereum (“Layer 1” or “L1”) to Layer 2 (“L2”) networks like Zora Network, OP Mainnet and Base that sit on top of Ethereum to enhance the speed and reduce the costs of performing onchain transactions. Nouns Builder's native bridge allows you to transfer your ETH from Ethereum to the Zora Network, OP Mainnet and Base.

##### Why do I need to bridge my ETH?
You must bridge your ETH to an L2 in order to transact on the L2, for example, to bid on L2 auctions or vote on L2 proposals.

##### What happens to my ETH when I am bridging?
By bridging your ETH, you are making it available for use within the L2 environment. When you bridge ETH to an L2 supported on Nouns Builder i.e. Zora Network, OP Mainnet and Base, your ETH will be usable on the L2 Network but will no longer be accessible on L1 Ethereum until such ETH has been withdrawn back to the L1.  Importantly, your ETH remains in your cryptocurrency wallet - neither Nouns Builder nor any other third party takes custody, possession, or control of your funds.



## Bridging ETH to L2 networks on Nouns Builder
Nouns Builder currently supports deposit-only bridging to Zora Network, OP Mainnet and Base. We use the native bridge for each of these L2 networks.

To bridge on Nouns Builder:
1. Connect your wallet on [nouns.build](https://nouns.build).
2. Select "Bridge" in the navigation bar.
3. Select the chain you would like to deposit ETH to.
4. Enter the desired ETH amount.
5. Click "Bridge" to begin bridging your ETH to the selected network. This will prompt a wallet transaction to accept a gas fee.
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet. **This may take ~1-2 minutes, depending on how congested Ethereum mainnet is.**
7. Your ETH has been bridged.
8. Enjoy Nouns Builder on L2!
